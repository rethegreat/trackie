## Framework

Trackie is built with a MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

MongoDB is a noSQL database used for storing the data for the app.
Express.js is a back-end web application framework that runs on the server and handles the backend logic of the app.
React is a front-end JavaScript library used for building user interfaces and handling the front-end logic of the app.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows the app to run on the server and execute the code written in JavaScript.

The MERN stack allows for a full-stack JavaScript development, making it easier for developers to build and maintain the app.
